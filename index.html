<h2>ðŸ‘‹ About Me</h2>
<p style="font-size: 13px;">
I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Seoul National University (SNU), where I also received my B.S. degree in ECE.

My current advisor is Prof. <a href="https://icl.snu.ac.kr/pi">Se Young Chun, under whom I conduct research in computational imaging and computer vision. Previously, I worked with Prof. <a href="https://icl.snu.ac.kr/pi">Byoungho Lee and Prof. <a href="https://icl.snu.ac.kr/pi">Yoonchan Jeong, focusing on nanophotonics and metasurface-based optical systems.

My research background bridges both optical physics and artificial intelligence. In the past, I explored advanced imaging systems and light modulation using nanophotonic and metasurface technologies. Currently, my work centers on leveraging Generative AI for diverse applications in computer vision and computational imaging.

Looking ahead, my goal is to integrate these two domains â€” from optical imaging system design to AI-driven signal processing algorithms â€” to develop next-generation intelligent imaging systems that seamlessly combine physics and machine intelligence.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p style="font-size: 13px;">My research interests broadly lie in <b>"efficient"</b> AI. I aim to make AI systems resource-, computation-, and parameter-efficient across all stages of development and deployment.
While I am interested in both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), my current focus is on CV tasks. Specifically, my research explores, but is not limited to, the following areas:</p>
<ul style="margin: 0; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li>Generative AI</li>
  <li>Computational Imaging</li>
  <li>Nanophotonics, Metasurfaces</li>
</ul>
