<h2>ðŸ‘‹ About Me</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">
I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Seoul National University (SNU), where I also received my B.S. degree in ECE.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">
My current advisor is Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3jLuG64AAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao">Se Young Chun</a>, under whom I conduct research in computational imaging and computer vision. Previously, I worked with Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VExwDP4AAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao">Byoungho Lee</a> and Prof. <a href="http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr/PROFJ">Yoonchan Jeong</a>, focusing on nanophotonics and metasurface-based optical systems.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">
My research background bridges both optical physics and artificial intelligence. In the past, I explored advanced imaging systems and light modulation using nanophotonic and metasurface technologies. Currently, my work centers on leveraging Generative AI for diverse applications in computer vision and computational imaging.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">
Looking ahead, my goal is to integrate these two domains â€” from optical imaging system design to AI-driven signal processing algorithms â€” to develop next-generation intelligent imaging systems that seamlessly combine physics and machine intelligence.
</p>

<!-- <h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p style="font-size: 13px;">My research interests broadly lie in <b>"efficient"</b> AI. I aim to make AI systems resource-, computation-, and parameter-efficient across all stages of development and deployment.
While I am interested in both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), my current focus is on CV tasks. Specifically, my research explores, but is not limited to, the following areas:</p>
<ul style="margin: 0; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li>Generative AI</li>
  <li>Computational Imaging</li>
  <li>Nanophotonics, Metasurfaces</li>
</ul> -->
